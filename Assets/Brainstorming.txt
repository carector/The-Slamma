DOOR GAME

Premise
- First person
- Like hotline miami where you can fuck people up with doors
- Left click: Kick down a door
- Right click: Rip door off hinges and use it as a melee weapon (but breaks after a few swings)

Game progression
- Roguelike-ish, split up into rooms separated by doors
- Rooms are prefabs like binding of isaac
- Enemies spawn with rooms and can follow you through them (navmesh)
- Cleared rooms won't appear again if you backtrack: It instead spawns a new room
- Try and rack up as many points as possible
- 3-heart health system (not sure if ways to regen health should exist)

Concerns
- Hard to deal with enemies once in a room if you miss your chance when you kick down the door
- AI might be tricky given time constraints

Ideas
- Glass walls inside rooms to let you know when enemies are near a door
- Random doors attached to walls without doorframes - you can knock them back and forth like a punching bag
   - Pair that with springs to have a door knock back and forth in a bap bap motion
- Doors close automatically if left alone for a while - unloads previous room
- Prison cell doors so you can see through them
- Varied doors could spice things up: Heavier ones could deal more damage
- "THE SLAMMER"
