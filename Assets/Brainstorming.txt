DOOR GAME

Premise
- First person
- Like hotline miami where you can fuck people up with doors
- Left click: Kick down a door
- Right click: Rip door off hinges and use it as a melee weapon (but breaks after a few swings)

Game progression
- Roguelike-ish, split up into rooms separated by doors
- Rooms are prefabs like binding of isaac
- Enemies spawn with rooms and can follow you through them (navmesh)
- Cleared rooms won't appear again if you backtrack: It instead spawns a new room
- Try and rack up as many points as possible
- 3-heart health system (not sure if ways to regen health should exist)

Concerns
- Hard to deal with enemies once in a room if you miss your chance when you kick down the door
- AI might be tricky given time constraints

Ideas
- Glass walls inside rooms to let you know when enemies are near a door
- Random doors attached to walls without doorframes - you can knock them back and forth like a punching bag
   - Pair that with springs to have a door knock back and forth in a bap bap motion
- Doors close automatically if left alone for a while - unloads previous room
- Prison cell doors so you can see through them
- Varied doors could spice things up: Heavier ones could deal more damage
- "THE SLAMMER"


POSTJAM IDEAS

- Two enemy types: Guards and prisoners
	- Prisoners are fodder enemies, pretty easy to deal with
	- Guards have guns and demand more attention
	- If you deliberately free prisoners they'll focus on fighting guards they see before fighting you

- Held door features
	- Holding right mouse will hold door as shield: Protects punches and bullets
	- Slamming door knocks you BACK instead of forwards - can be used to cross gaps as well

- Kick door features
	- After door has been opened: Hold lmb to pull door towards you, release to launch

- Escaping the prison
	- Clear enough rooms and you'll eventually make your way outside

- Special rooms
	- Hard-to-reach entrances lead to difficult rooms with high rewards

Required mechanics:
- Player controller
- Enemy prefab (just one)
- Door class
- Game manager / room spawn handler
- Score system: Factors in time + way you kill enemies
- Postgame leaderboard
