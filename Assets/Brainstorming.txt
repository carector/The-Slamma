DOOR GAME

Premise
- First person
- Like hotline miami where you can fuck people up with doors
- Left click: Kick down a door
- Right click: Rip door off hinges and use it as a melee weapon (but breaks after a few swings)

Game progression
- Roguelike-ish, split up into rooms separated by doors
- Rooms are prefabs like binding of isaac
- Enemies spawn with rooms and can follow you through them (navmesh)
- Cleared rooms won't appear again if you backtrack: It instead spawns a new room
- Try and rack up as many points as possible
- 3-heart health system (not sure if ways to regen health should exist)

Concerns
- Hard to deal with enemies once in a room if you miss your chance when you kick down the door
- AI might be tricky given time constraints

Ideas
- Glass walls inside rooms to let you know when enemies are near a door
- Random doors attached to walls without doorframes - you can knock them back and forth like a punching bag
   - Pair that with springs to have a door knock back and forth in a bap bap motion
- Doors close automatically if left alone for a while - unloads previous room
- Prison cell doors so you can see through them
- Varied doors could spice things up: Heavier ones could deal more damage
- "THE SLAMMER"


POSTJAM IDEAS

- Two enemy types: Guards and prisoners
	- Prisoners are fodder enemies, pretty easy to deal with
	- Guards have guns and demand more attention
	- If you deliberately free prisoners they'll focus on fighting guards they see before fighting you

- Held door features
	- Holding right mouse will hold door as shield: Protects punches and bullets
	- Slamming door knocks you BACK instead of forwards - can be used to cross gaps as well

- Kick door features
	- After door has been opened: Hold lmb to pull door towards you, release to launch

- Escaping the prison
	- Clear enough rooms and you'll eventually make your way outside

- Special rooms
	- Hard-to-reach entrances lead to difficult rooms with high rewards

Required mechanics:
- Player controller
- Enemy prefab (just one)
- Door class
- Game manager / room spawn handler
- Score system: Factors in time + way you kill enemies (also add text blurbs for different score abilities)
- Postgame leaderboard


ADD DISCLAIMER TO ENABLE HARDWARE ACCELERATION


Left mouse: Kick door open
If door is already open: Left mouse slams it instead
Right mouse: Rip door off hinges


THINGS LEFT TO DO (DO *NOT* FEATURE CREEP BEYOND THIS)
- Levels
	- Make 25 normal room variants and 10 hard-to-reach variants
	//? Potentially make hard-to-reach variants spawn normally at a very low rate
	- Find a way to make enemies only get deleted if they're in a deleted room
	// Make treasure chests to place in hard-to-reach rooms

- Enemies
	// Fix bullets from killing cops
	- Make bullets kill prisoners
	// Maybe add vertical movement to bullets
	//? After score threshold is reached, enemies get tougher: Higher spawn rates + faster move / shoot speeds

- UI
	//? Title screen with start and quit buttons, credits off to the side
	//? Score threshold bar (minimum required before exit can appear)
	- Add score "descriptions" based on how you kill someone
		- Single line of text that appears above score before fading out

- Audio
	- Replace wood sounds
	- Maybe add ambience

- Detail
	- Attack animation for prisoner, directional sprites for both enemies (4 is probably enough)
	- Arm model that grabs doors when you pull them towards you
	- Maybe bring an artist on board to help flesh out rooms / design some posters or textures

- Miscellaneous
	// Intro comic panels / cutscene showing how the prison riot started
	// Tutorial level: Kicking doors, hitting enemies with doors, grabbing+slamming to gain height, guarding
	- End cutscene: Car pulls up, you kick in the door (or pull it off its hinges) and drive off
	// Newgrounds scoreboards+medals (reusable for other projects too, only downside is icons don't work due to webp format)
